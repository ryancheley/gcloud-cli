DESCRIPTION
    (PREVIEW) Preview versions of gcloud commands.

GLOBAL FLAGS
     --account=ACCOUNT
        Google Cloud user account to use for invocation. Overrides the default
        core/account property value for this command invocation.

     --billing-project=BILLING_PROJECT
        The Google Cloud project that will be charged quota for operations
        performed in gcloud. If you need to operate on one project, but need
        quota against a different project, you can use this flag to specify the
        billing project. If both billing/quota_project and --billing-project
        are specified, --billing-project takes precedence. Run $ gcloud config
        set --help to see more information about billing/quota_project.

     --configuration=CONFIGURATION
        File name of the configuration to use for this command invocation. For
        more information on how to use configurations, run: gcloud topic
        configurations. You can also use the CLOUDSDK_ACTIVE_CONFIG_NAME
        environment variable to set the equivalent of this flag for a terminal
        session.

     --flags-file=YAML_FILE
        A YAML or JSON file that specifies a --flag:value dictionary. Useful
        for specifying complex flag values with special characters that work
        with any command interpreter. Additionally, each --flags-file arg is
        replaced by its constituent flags. See $ gcloud topic flags-file for
        more information.

     --flatten=[KEY,...]
        Flatten name[] output resource slices in KEY into separate records for
        each item in each slice. Multiple keys and slices may be specified.
        This also flattens keys for --format and --filter. For example,
        --flatten=abc.def flattens abc.def[].ghi references to abc.def.ghi. A
        resource record containing abc.def[] with N elements will expand to N
        records in the flattened output. This allows us to specify what
        resource-key the filter will operate on. This flag interacts with other
        flags that are applied in this order: --flatten, --sort-by, --filter,
        --limit.

     --format=FORMAT
        Sets the format for printing command output resources. The default is a
        command-specific human-friendly output format. If both core/format and
        --format are specified, --format takes precedence. --format and
        core/format both take precedence over core/default_format. The
        supported formats are limited to: config, csv, default, diff, disable,
        flattened, get, json, list, multi, none, object, table, text, value,
        yaml. For more details run $ gcloud topic formats. Run $ gcloud config
        set --help to see more information about core/format

     --help
        Display detailed help.

     --project=PROJECT_ID
        The Google Cloud project ID to use for this invocation. If omitted,
        then the current project is assumed; the current project can be listed
        using gcloud config list --format='text(core.project)' and can be set
        using gcloud config set project PROJECTID.

        --project and its fallback core/project property play two roles in the
        invocation. It specifies the project of the resource to operate on. It
        also specifies the project for API enablement check, quota, and
        billing. To specify a different project for quota and billing, use
        --billing-project or billing/quota_project property.

     --quiet, -q
        Disable all interactive prompts when running gcloud commands. If input
        is required, defaults will be used, or an error will be raised.

        Overrides the default core/disable_prompts property value for this
        command invocation. This is equivalent to setting the environment
        variable CLOUDSDK_CORE_DISABLE_PROMPTS to 1.

     --verbosity=VERBOSITY; default="warning"
        Override the default verbosity for this command. Overrides the default
        core/verbosity property value for this command invocation. VERBOSITY
        must be one of: debug, info, warning, error, critical, none.

     --version, -v
        Print version information and exit. This flag is only available at the
        global level.

     -h
        Print a summary help and exit.

OTHER FLAGS
     --access-token-file=ACCESS_TOKEN_FILE
        A file path to read the access token. Use this flag to authenticate
        gcloud with an access token. The credentials of the active account (if
        exists) will be ignored. The file should only contain an access token
        with no other information. Overrides the default auth/access_token_file
        property value for this command invocation.

     --impersonate-service-account=SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAILS
        For this gcloud invocation, all API requests will be made as the given
        service account or target service account in an impersonation
        delegation chain instead of the currently selected account. You can
        specify either a single service account as the impersonator, or a
        comma-separated list of service accounts to create an impersonation
        delegation chain. The impersonation is done without needing to create,
        download, and activate a key for the service account or accounts.

        In order to make API requests as a service account, your currently
        selected account must have an IAM role that includes the
        iam.serviceAccounts.getAccessToken permission for the service account
        or accounts.

        The roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator role has the
        iam.serviceAccounts.getAccessToken permission. You can also create a
        custom role.

        You can specify a list of service accounts, separated with commas. This
        creates an impersonation delegation chain in which each service account
        delegates its permissions to the next service account in the chain.
        Each service account in the list must have the
        roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator role on the next service account
        in the list. For example, when --impersonate-service-account=
        SERVICE_ACCOUNT_1,SERVICE_ACCOUNT_2, the active account must have the
        roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator role on SERVICE_ACCOUNT_1, which
        must have the roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator role on
        SERVICE_ACCOUNT_2. SERVICE_ACCOUNT_1 is the impersonated service
        account and SERVICE_ACCOUNT_2 is the delegate.

        Overrides the default auth/impersonate_service_account property value
        for this command invocation.

     --log-http
        Log all HTTP server requests and responses to stderr. Overrides the
        default core/log_http property value for this command invocation.

     --trace-token=TRACE_TOKEN
        Token used to route traces of service requests for investigation of
        issues. Overrides the default core/trace_token property value for this
        command invocation.

     --user-output-enabled
        Print user intended output to the console. Overrides the default
        core/user_output_enabled property value for this command invocation.
        Use --no-user-output-enabled to disable.

NOTES
